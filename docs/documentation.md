# Project Overview

This project is a Console-Based To-Do List application written in Python for my CSFCP Assignment. It allows users to add, view, and remove tasks directly from the command line interface. The project demonstrates basic programming concepts (lists, input/output, control flow) and practical use of Git version control and GitHub collaboration.

# Stepwise Development Process

1. **Initial Setup**
    - Created project folder and organized files (`todo.py`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `docs/documentation.md`, `screenshots/`).
    - Initialized local Git repository and pushed to GitHub.

    **Screenshots**

2. **Core Functionality**
    - Developed Python code for the menu-driven To-Do List application.
    - Tested add, view, and remove task features.
    - Committed progress at each major step (see commit history for details).

3. **Documentation & Screenshots**
    - Wrote README.md with project details, features, and instructions.
    - Added clear screenshots of the console output to the `screenshots/` folder.

4. **Version Control**
    - Used meaningful commit messages and maintained at least five versioned stages.
    - Ensured a proper repository structure with `.gitignore` for cleanliness.

# Challenges Faced

- Ensuring the menu logic handled invalid inputs gracefully.
- Structuring the code for maintainability (separating tasks functions and main loop).
- Learning to use Git commands and GitHub version control correctly.

# Future Improvements

- Implement saving/loading tasks to a file for persistence between runs.
- Add deadlines or priority to tasks.
- Build a simple GUI version.
- Enable collaboration and code review features via GitHub for real-world workflow practice.
